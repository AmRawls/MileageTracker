# MileageTracker
The application I used when traveling for work. I would activate the program when I arrived at my destination and used TomTom API to track mileage and time from destination. It would then add this data and other calculated values to an Excel spreadsheet to be turned in for reimbursement. 

What the project does:
- Uses the TomTom API to track the mileage and time per trip between destinations and logs the data into an Excel spreadsheet.

Why the project is useful
- This project is useful to anyone who travels for work and needs to easily track the mileage for reimbursement purposes.
